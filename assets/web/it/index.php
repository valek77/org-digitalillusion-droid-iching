  Cielo su Cielo. Possibilità di espansione. L’uscita di questo esagramma invita anche all’attenzione: attuare i tuoi più profondi desideri non deve diventare una nuova mania, un nuovo ostacolo, una nuova opponente separazione tra te e gli altri, te e il mondo. 
  E’ essenziale trovare concretamente qualcosa di giusto a cui dare forma, per iniziare a costruire nel mondo ciò che hai mancato di fare finora, ma che è stato sempre lì, ad aspettare che tu fossi abbastanza forte e maturo per poter cominciare. 
  Ora puoi e devi, ora hai la forza, il potere, le condizioni: ti sei liberato dalla zavorra delle passate situazioni e può iniziare un periodo di costruzione: sta a te trovare cosa costruire. Creatività persistente nel tempo.

' Esagramma 2 – La non azione che fa crescere.\e
  Terra sopra e Terra sotto: infinite possibilità sono assorbite ancora nel grembo, ma non si manifestano.
  A volte si pensa che starsene tranquillamente senza lanciarsi in nessuna impresa sia una debolezza o una stasi. Ma il non fare, quando si è colmi di buoni semi, è il modo per farli maturare e perfezionarli. La Terra nutre anche ciò che ancora non si manifesta; ciò che è vivo e pulsante dentro di te viene portato a compimento soltanto  dietro le scene, per poi fiorire. E’ il tempo di accudire e curare tutti i semi che nel corso del tempo sono attecchiti in te e se ti consenti di lanciare uno sguardo nel tuo cuore ci trovi  ricchezze e tesori che hai dimenticato e trascurato. La Terra di questo esagramma è la casa, in psicanalisi è il Sé, nel suo aspetto femminile, massimamente intuitivo e immaginativo, dove le forze si stanno raccogliendo ora per poi manifestarsi alla coscienza e alla vita attiva. Come fa la terra quando mantiene il suo calore interno per nutrire e alimentare le minuscole creature che vi abitano, ora devi  abbracciare ciò che intimamente senti di essere e nutrirlo. Allontanati da ciò che è freddo e richiede sforzo e agitazione, avvicinati naturalmente a ciò che è caldo e supportivo, come una madre. Spesso chiedi cose astratte e senza fondamento trascurando invece ciò che già hai a portata di mano, e il movimento verso l’esterno talvolta non attinge alle tue reali  potenzialità, distraendoti soltanto da ciò che è veramente degno e in armonia con il tuo cammino.
  Ora è il tempo di credere in sé e nelle proprie grandi risorse, che possono condurre, se amate e nutrite a grande successo. Un enorme cambiamento sta prendendo forma: lascia che compia il suo lavoro dentro di te, senza opporti, riconosci cosa è ancora giovane e immaturo e amalo e alimentalo per farlo crescere per definirsi. Si può alimentare questo sé ancora implume essendo ricettivi e aperti e disponendosi a salutare ciò che accade come un aiuto verso la crescita. Ciò implica un’attitudine incondizionata e serena a ricevere più che a dare e può darsi che vi siano persone intorno a te che finiranno per allontanarsi, mentre si avvicineranno altri che sono al tuo livello di ricettività.  Il compito è proprio quello di rivolgerti verso ciò che può fertilizzare ora per promuovere la tua  armonia interiore, in una cosciente veglia sui tuoi reali bisogni. Ricorda che ciò che ti spinge a reagire ora non agevola la tua crescita e che questo momento di quiete e amore deve essere difeso dai pensieri di lotta e sfide, tutti provenienti da disturbi e ostacoli. Se riesci a superare le infinite sollecitazioni di muoverti verso obiettivi per ora immaturi, la strada sarà sempre liscia, e spianata verso una fioritura per ora inimmaginabile. Dormi e cresci. Sogna.';

' THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,
  Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. 
  If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
  He goes astray;
  But if he follows, he finds guidance.
  It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
  To forego friends in the east and north.
  Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.\e
  The four fundamental aspects of the Creative–"sublime success, furthering through perseverance"–are also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the gentleness and devotion of the cow.
  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature\'s richness lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. It is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead–that would only make him lose the way–but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate.
  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all one\'s powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates and favoritism.';

  Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.';

' Six at the beginning means:
  When there is hoarfrost underfoot,
  Solid ice is not far off. \e
  Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy, represents death. When the first hoarfrost comes in the autumn, the power of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here.
  In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them in time.';
$book['02']['line2'] = 
' Six in the second place means:
  Straight, square, great. 
  Without purpose,
  Yet nothing remains unfurthered. \e
  The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort\' yet everything turns out as it should.
  Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.';

If conditions demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does with restraint. The wise man gladly leaves fame to others.

When anyone is called upon to work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on the utmost discretion. A man\'s genuineness and refinement should not reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as an effect from within.';

If it attempts to maintain a position to which it is not entitled and to rule instead of serving, it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the earth principle. Midnight blue is the color of heaven; yellow is the color of earth. Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.';

' Esagramma 4 – L’Apprendistato.
  Stoltezza giovanile ha riuscita. Non sono  io a cercare  il giovane stolto, il giovane stolto cerca me. Consultato una prima volta, io rispondo. Se egli consulta due, tre volte è importuno. Se egli importuna, non rispondo.Propizia è perseveranza.\e
  Un monte che ha davanti a sé un abisso contenente acqua.
  La risposta alla domanda è che prima di arrivare a un qualche risultato  è indispensabile  apprendere a superare l’abisso, cioè un errore di fondo, un impedimento, contro cui ci si blocca, ansiosi di ottenere che  il nostro desiderio si realizzi, perdendo di vista invece le lezioni dell’esperienza. Che cosa si è imparato, fin qui? Quale è la lezione che si doveva imparare e che è stata trascurata? A volte nel tentativo di mantenere speranze in vita, gli ostacoli e difficoltà vengono ignorati e messi da parte, con ingenua e un po’ sciocca noncuranza; ma è proprio con quegli avvertimenti che la vita ci impartisce le sue lezioni. Il bambino impara che ci sono frustrazioni e così  ad adattarsi al mondo; e  da adulti impariamo, dalle situazioni che si presentano, a distinguere tra quelle percorribili e quelle da scartare, per ora. Quando non si è capaci di distinguere tra impossibilità e possibilità stiamo solo fantasticando, in una insormontabile frattura tra ciò che vogliamo e ciò che è realizzabile concretamente. Le fantasie, cariche di potenziale creativo, sono scollegate dal  nostro modo di agire; e così, in preda a infantili speranze, spesso compiamo errori madornali, per poi continuare a chiederci perché non riusciamo a realizzare quello che desideriamo. In questa situazione o chiediamo consiglio a una guida sicura o apriamo gli occhi per vedere lo stato delle cose.  Quando chiediamo a qualcun altro di aiutarci a risolvere un problema,  e ci dica come fare e cosa fare,  ci avviciniamo a chi ci consiglia con umiltà e desiderio di imparare: così vi è scambio, apertura e costruzione di qualcosa di nuovo. Ma quando  agiamo seguendo l’impulso invece che secondo ciò che ci consiglia qualcun altro, insomma ci mettiamo in gioco, la situazione può sembrare incerta e carica di pericoli.   Ma poiché, a tutti gli effetti, imparare dagli errori è il solo modo per imparare alcunché, forse è arrivato il momento di assumersi la responsabilità anche di fallire. Questo è un tempo di errori e di apprendimento attraverso gli errori. Ma gli errori si pagano, e duramente, se restano semplici impedimenti e non maestri di vita.
  Bussiamo alle porte del futuro agli ordini di speranze e timori, e poi ci meravigliamo che le porte non si aprano: questo è il segno dell’ inesperienza, della stoltezza, ma anche di una certa innocenza. E per fortuna il senso dell’esagramma si concentra sulla qualità dell’innocenza, della nostra mancanza di visione e sull’apprendistato necessario per acquisirla. Mete lontane come vette inaccessibili e vergini sono fantasie che ci distraggono dal presente; e difficilmente si può creare qualcosa di durevole se non impariamo mai nulla dal passato. Quando la vita ci impartisce lezioni, più volte, e noi ignoriamo la lezione, più volte, l’innocenza diventa  stoltezza giovanile, e di conseguenza la porta resta ancora chiusa davanti a noi.
  Assumiamoci la responsabilità di prendere decisioni, mettiamoci veramente in gioco; smettiamo di chiedere su future realizzazioni  – per concentrarci su quello che onestamente sappiamo  e possiamo fare e abbiamo a disposizione ora. Temere e non fidarsi di se stessi , come atteggiamento di vita, ci rende privi della qualità fondamentale per riuscire in qualunque impresa: imparare dall’esperienza, dalla nostra personale  Storia, fatta di cadute e delusioni ma anche di risalite e passione; è questo il maestro a cui chiedere una guida. Ma quando non vogliamo o sappiamo farlo, non ci resta, come bambini sperduti, che cercare sostegni e aiuti esterni e procedere. Se infatti nonostante i ripetuti insuccessi si continuano a commettere gli stessi errori, a causa dell’ incapacità di imparare,  allora bisogna  modificare qualcosa e adottare un comportamento diverso; anche se in tempi di crisi, per una persona indebolita dai colpi della vita, è difficile seguire strade scomode che  conducano al nuovo. Ma imparare è spesso scomodo e difficile, soprattutto se si pensa di aver già capito tutto.
  Parole chiave:   Incoscienza. Bisogna imparare dall’esperienza e non insistere in atteggiamenti fatui. Assumersi la responsabilità di andare avanti sapendo già che le  cadute, se ci saranno, insegneranno a chiarire meglio gli obiettivi. Chi non ha obiettivi chiari e non si assume responsabilità non sarà mai maestro, soltanto uno che vaga in preda a speranze e timori.

  Perseverance furthers.\e
  In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.
  A teacher\'s answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.

E’ il modo in cui attendiamo e passiamo il tempo a  trasformare una  situazione di stallo in un periodo costruttivo e  benefico: si impara a rallentare, ad aver pazienza e non forzare. Il successo arriva in questa impresa al pari passo della nostra capacità di bastarsi e di trovare soddisfazione in altre imprese, forse più modeste ma costruttive. Il nobile va per la sua strada, tenendosi lontano dall’ombra e i suoi richiami.

  One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately.

  Il Cielo, calmo e aperto sul pericoloso e infido Abissale. Tra i due, il nulla. Ciascuno dei due è quello che è, e non può assumere altra natura. Non si tratta di torti o ragioni, ma di incompatibilità di punti di vista. Quando nasce una divergenza, la maggior parte delle persone che fa? Si arma e cerca di costringere l’altro a reagire, e allora la lite è iniziata e continuerà per sempre. Non ci sarà nessun tornaconto, ci si è fatto un nemico, e basta. In questa situazione non bisogna quindi agire con aggressività o volontà di sopraffare. Far valere le proprie ragioni  non serve, quando la natura del rapporto è conflittuale fin dall’inizio: occorre allora adoperarsi di pazienza e continuare per la propria strada, senza curarsi dell’offesa che riteniamo ci sia stata fatta. Comportatevi come  avete fatto finora: restate con quel nulla che avete cercato di immaginare diverso….e rendetevi conto che non potrà mai essere come sperate.  Il problema qui è la mancanza di comunicazione: non siete in grado di capirvi l’un l’altro, e in fondo, ciò significa che non vi conoscete l’un l’altro. C’è una grande incomprensione di fondo tra voi. All’inizio del vostro rapporto la distanza tra voi già esisteva, non si è formata nel tempo o in seguito a qualcosa. Il vostro rapporto è condizionato proprio da questa incompatibilità di visione e se finora ci sono stati punti in comune è perché avete cercato di adattarvi e di mediare le divergenze. Cosa che potete continuare benissimo a fare, come l’esagramma consiglia. L’asino non diventa un cavallo solo perché lo volete voi. Quindi si tratta di lasciare da parte la litigiosità e venire a patti con l’orgoglio, l’ira e tutte le speranze e le paure che covate nel cuore ed ammettere che la natura del vostro rapporto è tale fin dall’inizio e che è pura illusione sperare di cambiare le cose.

  An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting force. Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a last recourse.
  The justifying cause of a war, and clear and intelligible war aims, ought to be explained to the people by an experienced leader. Unless there is a quite definite war aim to which the people can consciously pledge themselves, the unity and strength of conviction that lead to victory will not be forthcoming.

On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may have been misread as shih, which means "corpse.

Ecco che entra in scena la mitezza, grande qualità del Nobile. Ciò vuol dire che le nostre azioni presenti sono in linea con il nostro cammino, e fiduciosi bisogna proseguire. Non preoccupiamoci del nome, della fama, dell’opinione che pensiamo di avere di noi stessi: siamo accettati dagli altri perché siamo sinceri e modesti, senza velleità di successo immediato.

La debolezza allora non è un ostacolo, perchè la si vive con pazienza e tenerezza interiormente; e anche se esteriormente la presenza di qualcosa o qualcuno impedisce la nostra volontà, il nostro essere miti, flessibili e più rilassati ci permetterà in seguito di giungere a una decisione ben definita.

' Esagramma 10 – Procedere
  Procedere sulla coda di una tigre.
  Se essa non morde,
  Riuscita.\e
  Il Cielo sta sul Lago: ciò che è in alto non si mescola con ciò che sta in basso, il forte non è il debole,  chi guida non è chi è guidato,  perché sono diversi per qualità e caratteristiche. Così il Nobile distingue all’esterno e all’interno di sé le priorità e il posto consono delle cose e sceglie con cautela ciò che è necessario da ciò che non lo è. La situazione richiede attenzione.
  Spesso quando vogliamo compiere qualcosa, non ci chiediamo neppure di cosa la situazione ha bisogno per crescere e svilupparsi: nutriamo il momento con tutto quello che abbiamo, comprese le nostre speranze e le paure, tutte provenienti da egocentrismi infantili; non è il comportamento giusto, perché si mescolano alla cieca futili attaccamenti e saggezza, il che ci conduce dritti alla confusione per noi e per chi ci sta accanto. Qui è richiesta saggezza discriminante, cioè la capacità di definire con estrema precisione gli strumenti adatti allo scopo. Nelle relazioni ciò vuol dire smettere di essere rigidi ed autoreferenziali per comprendere ciò di cui l’altro ha bisogno. Invece cerchiamo di soffocare l’altro con le nostre proiezioni, gli sfoghi infantili pieni di biasimo e cruccio, provocando eccitamento e disgregazione. Bisogna ascoltare, vedere ciò che è necessario davvero e mettere da parte il superfluo rimuginio in una limpida e chiara definizione di quello che vogliamo ottenere. Se si sta cercando di costruire qualcosa, ci vuole il mattone giusto, la malta e la dedizione, altrimenti il muro crolla senza solidità, e alla fin fine abbiamo soltanto sprecato tempo ed energie.
  Dobbiamo ricorrere, allora, alle nostre qualità migliori: comprensione di ciò di cui l’altro ha bisogno, e di ciò che ci proponiamo: spesso sono la stessa cosa, ma noi, storditi dalle fantasie, crediamo che non sia così. L’innocenza proviene dalla purezza d’intento, che se accuratamente coltivata, si riverserà all’esterno ritornando a noi sottoforma di potere costruttivo. Certo, è come camminare sulla coda di una tigre: troppa cautela genera paura, e allora ella ci aggredisce; troppo impeto produce attrito, e ella non lo sopporterà.

  The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity, he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore blame attaches to his progress.

Even if people of like mind come forward together, they ought not to form a faction by holding together for mutual advantage; instead, each man should do is duty.

  This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Kên, Keeping Still, mountain, and K\'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great and strong men. K\'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.';

' MODESTY creates success. 
  The superior man carries things through. \e
  It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest.
  The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces. When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end without boasting of what he has achieved.';

Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty.

  A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is made much more difficult if many claims and considerations have to be taken into account. On the other hand, the task is easy if it is attended to quickly and simply.

The confidence of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits of the man in inferior place concealed. There are officials who indeed do not strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline all responsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bear empty titles.

  A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in reality. He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises nothing is easier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense perhaps, and draws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty that keeps him from defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating order and inspires one to begin by disciplining one\'s own ego and one\'s immediate circle.

  The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouse enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. These laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It is the same with human society: only such laws are rooted in popular sentiment can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment.

  When, at the beginning of summer, thunder–electrical energy–comes rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body. From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind.
  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated and regulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed to purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes and thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the theater developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests. of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions. This uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.

In his association with those beneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds are the first imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of good fortune (or misfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives the seeds and immediately takes action. He does not wait even a whole day. In the Book of Changes it is said: "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune. " Firm as a rock, what need of a whole day?

  This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram 27) with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature. Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung, CONFLICT (6), which refers to civil suits.';

  When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success. This is true in all situations.

Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
  However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is hard. Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create the just measure.

This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.

  After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The upper trigram K\'un is characterized by devotion; thus the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of heaven and earth.
  All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset.

This principle, i. e. , of allowing energy that is renewing itself to be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations.

' Ta Ch\'u / The Taming Power of the Great 
  Above KÊN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
  Below CH\'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\e
  The Creative is tamed by Kên, Keeping Still. This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch\'u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is far stronger.
  The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept "holding firm. " Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên which holds the trigram Ch\'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which represents the sage.';

  To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch\'ein points to strong creative power; Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one\'s bread by entering upon public office.

  In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them. Mencius says about this:
  If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The body has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injure important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferior parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior parts of his nature is a superior man.';

  This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K\'an. It is one of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K\'an means a plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K\'an is also the middle son. The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K\'an develops.

The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, "repetition of danger. " Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective attitude.

Duration is rather the self- contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion.
  Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and because of this their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the year follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects that endure.

The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference. The family is society in embryo; it is the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made easy through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships in general.';

If we begin too late to enforce order, when the will of the child has already been overindulged, the whims and passions, grown stronger with the years, offer resistance and give cause for remorse.

Here success can still be expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude all agreement.
  In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important functions.

  The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves; he composes his mind before he speaks; he makes his relations firm before he asks for something. By attending to these three matters, the superior man gains complete security. But if a man is brusque in his movements, others will not co-operate. If he is agitated in his words, they awaken no echo in others. If he asks for something without having first established relations, it will not be given to him.

When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order.

' THE WELL. The town may be changed,
  But the well cannot be changed. 
  It neither decreases nor increases. 
  They come and go and draw from the well. 
  If one gets down almost to the water
  And the rope does not go all the way,
  Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.\e
  In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains eternally the same–this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows neither less nor more; it exists for one and for all. The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.
  However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness–by which the jug is broken–is also disastrous. If for instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug.
  This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man\'s nature. But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention–a partial education of this sort is as bad as none–or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.';

' Ting / The Caldron 
  Above LI THE CLINGING, FIRE
  Below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD\e
  The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom are the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and at the top the carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment. The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the family served the food from the ting into the bowls of the guests.
  THE WELL (48) likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil pertaining to a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state.
  This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete, man-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation.
  Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of preparing food.';

  While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood, the present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society. Here it is the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible. Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the cosmic order.
  Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must be sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great good fortune and success.';

And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm footing.

  If a ting is turned upside down before being used, no harm is done–on the contrary, this clears it of refuse. A concubine\'s position is lowly, but because she has a son she comes to be honored.
  These two metaphors express the idea that in a highly developed civilization, such as that indicated by this hexagram, every person of good will can in some way or other succeed. No matter how lowly he may be, provided he is ready to purify himself, he is accepted. He attains a station in which he can prove himself fruitful in accomplishment, and as a result he gains recognition.';

  The handle is the means for lifting up the ting. If the handle is altered, the ting cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious food in it, such as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone.
  This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where no one notices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to his effectiveness. All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to waste. But if he will only see to it that he is possessed of something truly spiritual, the time is bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties will be resolved and all will go well.

Then the right thing is to keep still until composure and clarity are restored. But this a man can do only when he himself is not yet infected by the agitation, although its disastrous effects are already visible in those around him.

Come una divinità archetipica, non si ha bisogno di eccitare e creare cause ed effetti per stabilire ciò che si è. L’idea del cambiamento è tutta inclusa nel lasciare le cose come sono e rilassarsi in esse. E’ il principio del wuwei, a cui questo esagramma si ispira.

No influence such as that exerted by agitators has a lasting effect.
  Within the personality too, development must follow the same course if lasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same time penetrating, is the outer form that should proceed from inner calm.

  The tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its development influences the landscape of the entire region. It does not shoot up like a swamp plant; its growth proceeds gradually. Thus also the work of influencing people can be only gradual. No sudden influence or awakening is of lasting effect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such progress in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for the personality to acquire influence and weight.

  All the individual lines in this hexagram symbolize the gradual flight of the wild goose. The wild goose is the symbol of conjugal fidelity, because it is believed that this bird never takes another mate after the death of the first.
  The initial line suggests the first resting place in the flight of water birds from the water to the heights. The shore is reached. The situation is that of a lonely young man who is just starting out to make his way in life. Since no one comes to help him, his first steps are slow and hesitant, and he is surrounded by danger. Naturally he is subjected to much criticism. But these very difficulties keep him from being too hasty, and his progress is successful.';

This first success, opening up a path to activity, brings a certain joyousness of mood, and one goes to meet the future reassured.
  It is said of the wild goose that it calls to its comrades whenever it finds food; this is the symbol of peace and concord in good fortune. A man does not want to keep his good luck for himself only, but is ready to share it with others.';

  It is the same in human life. If we do not let things develop quietly but plunge of our own choice too rashly into a struggle, misfortune results. A man jeopardizes his own life, and his family perishes thereby. However, this is not all necessary; it is only the result of transgressing the law of natural development.

A man\'s life too, in the course of its development, often brings him into inappropriate situations, in which he finds it difficult to hold his own without danger.

  The meaning is that a girl entering a family with the consent of the wife will not rank outwardly as the equal of the latter but will withdraw modestly into the background. However, if she understands how to fit herself into the pattern of things, her position will be entirely satisfactory, and she will feel sheltered in the love of the husband to whom she bears children.
  The same meaning is brought out in the relationships between officials. A man may enjoy the personal friendship of a prince and be taken into his confidence.

  The king approaches his temple.

  The text of this hexagram resembles that of Ts\'ui, GATHERING TOGETHER (45). In the latter, the subject is the bringing together of elements that have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon the earth. Here the subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism. DISPERSION shows the way, so to speak, that leads to gathering together. This explains the similarity of the two texts.
  Religious forces are needed to overcome the egotism that divides men. The common celebration of the great sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression simultaneously to the interrelation and social articulation of family and state, was the means of employed by the great rulers to unite men. The sacred music and the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide of emotion that was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co-operation in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the people; in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as, when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint task.
  But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations, and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving the hardness of egotism.';

On the other hand, each of the two trigrams has a firm line in the middle; this indicates the force of inner truth in the influences they represent.
  The attributes of the two trigrams are: above, gentleness, forbearance toward inferiors; below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible.
  The character of fu ("truth") is actually the picture of a bird\'s foot over a fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow.

  Pigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and therefore the most difficult to influence. The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been opened, the force of one\'s personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed.
  But it is important to understand upon what the force inner truth depends. This force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond. Close ties may exist also among thieves; it is true that such a bond acts as a force but, since it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune. All association on the basis of common interests holds only up to a certain point.

The effect is but the reflection of something that emanates from one\'s own heart. Any deliberate intention of an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it.

  The structure of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is brought by a bird. In Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT (28), the four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lines without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak lines are both outside and preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird.

This unusual behavior is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex.

He may indeed not remain altogether untouched by the disastrous consequences of the general pressure, but he is hit only from behind like a fox that, having crossed the water, at the last minute gets its tail wet. He will not suffer any real harm, because his behavior has been correct.';

  The woman loses the curtain of her carriage. 
  Do not run after it;
  On the seventh day you will get it. \e
  When a woman drove out in her carriage, she had a curtain that hid her from the glances of the curious. It was regarded as a breach of propriety to drive on if this curtain was lost. Applied to public life, this means that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times "after completion" it may happen that those who have come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering new talent.
  This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man\'s superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: "Do not seek it. " Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man\'s own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord. He need only be able to wait.';

  The Illustrious Ancestor
  Disciplines the Devil\'s Country. 
  After three years he conquers it. 
  Inferior people must not be employed. \e
  "Illustrious Ancestor" is the dynastic title of the Emperor Wu Ting of the Yin dynasty. After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he waged long colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northern borderland with constant threat of incursions.
  The situation described is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especially important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have made themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking.';

  In a time of flowering culture, an occasional convulsion is bound to occur, uncovering a hidden evil within society and at first causing a great sensation. But since the situation is favorable on the whole, such evils can easily be glossed over and concealed from the public. Then everything is forgotten and peace apparently reigns complacently once more. However, to the thoughtful man, such occurrences are grave omens that he does not neglect.

  Religious attitudes are likewise influenced by the spiritual atmosphere prevailing in times after completion. In divine worship the simple old forms are replaced by an ever more elaborate ritual and an ever greater outward display. But inner seriousness is lacking in this show of magnificence; human caprice takes the place of conscientious obedience to the divine will. However, while man sees what is before his eyes, God looks into the heart. Therefore a simple sacrifice offered with real piety holds a greater blessing than an impressive service without warmth.';

  Here in conclusion another warning is added. After crossing a stream, a man\'s head can get into the water only if he is so imprudent as to turn back. As long as he goes forward and does not look back, he escapes this danger. But there is a fascination in standing still and looking back on a peril overcome. However, such vain self-admiration brings misfortune. It leads only to danger, and unless one finally resolves to go forward without pausing, one falls a victim to this danger.';

The change is indeed prepared for, since all the lines in the upper trigram are in relation to those in the lower. However, they are not yet in their places.

  But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,
  Gets his tail in the water,
  There is nothing that would further. \e
  The conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility. It is nothing less than that of leading the world out of confusion back to order. But it is a task that promises success, because there is a goal that can unite the forces now tending in different directions. At first, however, one must move warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution of a fox walking over ice is proverbial in China. His ears are constantly alert to the cracking of the ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches out the safest spots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this caution goes ahead boldly, and it may happen that he falls in and gets his tail wet when he is almost across the water. Then of course his effort has been all in vain. Accordingly, in times "before completion," deliberation and caution are the prerequisites of success.';

  When fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and water, which flows downward, is below, their effects take opposite directions and remain unrelated. If we wish to achieve an effect, we must first investigate the nature of the forces in question and ascertain their proper place.

Instead, an individual must develop in himself the strength that will enable him to go forward. He must have a vehicle, as it were, to effect the crossing.
